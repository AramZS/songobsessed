I'm not a huge Beyoncé fan, obviously her capability to put out consistently good music is pretty unmatched and I enjoy her stuff when I hear it, but it isn't the type of music I go out of my way to listen to, for the most part (with a few specific tracks as exceptions). That said, I really like this particular song. I think Beyoncé has consistently had country influences in her music, and I don't feel like this new album (though I do like it) is some huge stylistic change for her, it feels more like the direction she's always been moving. 

I also really have actually enjoyed her stuff the most when she leans into that country music inspiration, so this album is a treat for me. 

As time has gone on, I've become more and more appreciative of how Miley Cyrus's fairly unique voice. It doesn't work for everything, but when used in the right place it's amazing. This is definitely one of those places that uses her to her maximum potential. 

It sounds great! I love the way the two voices work together and the way the song is structured. It's a great track.
