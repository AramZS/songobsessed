I don't know what happened this month. Somehow Let's Eat Grandma and their self-identified genre of [Sludge Pop](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4AEQLLgos0tCdSM1aFsBNB?si=e7872759e3514ebd), a wall-of-sound-glitch-infused pop sugar sound, [just clicked in for me](https://aramzs.xyz/microblogs/when-you-come-back-around-to-the-music-and-find-it-lovely/) and every time I switch back to music with that sound it moves me, both metaphorically and physically. 

I have been diving in and filling out a playlist of matched music but this song is what really set me off. There's something that dances in it that is both gorgeous nature and clashing human machinery drawing my attention when it comes on and setting a tear in my eye. 

I think I'll likely have another obsession to pull in from this genre soon, but there's something special here that feels like a key to better appreciate Let's Eat Grandma and a whole swath of artists who are playing in a similar space. 

When I connected with From the Morning it led me back to a bunch of other songs and artists that I had heard years before, appreciated as technically competent, but just couldn't get in to. 

This song is a take on a Nick Drake track apparently, but that shouldn't be taken to imply anything negative the rest of their song writing. [I've selected Let's Eat Grandma as an obsession before](https://songobsessed.com/artist/lets-eat-grandma/) after having first encountered them as the authors of the soundtrack to [The Bastard Son & the Devil Himself](https://aramzs.xyz/resources/tv/the-bastard-son-and-the-devil-himself/), which I really enjoyed (the soundtrack a little more than the show, but the show was good too).

Another strong entry in the obsession list as a song that straight up takes over my brain. This track is gorgeous.
