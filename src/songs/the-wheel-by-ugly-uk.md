Wow this whole album is great. I had a hard time deciding which track to pick off of Twice Around the Sun by Ugly (UK). They are all fascinating tracks from a band that is doing a lot on this album. 

I really enjoyed all the music but ended up picking this one for being pretty great, having a nice lead-in, and demonstrating how Ugly (UK) is capable of building these well-blended layers of sound.

That said, you should absolutely [check out the full album](https://open.spotify.com/album/3wzMjiyIQ2zDv3suwSHxpp?si=VK6CtQgbR-KPh6mY7dLBZg).
