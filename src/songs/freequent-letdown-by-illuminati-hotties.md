I've been pretty overworked and got COVID again. So I don't have a lot to write about this song but, perhaps because of all that, I've been getting really into [bubblegrunge/tenderpunk](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1qAseMqwXTOZL7M4tdV2Wm?si=abb1d31cb88441a8) artists lately. Looking forward to seeing illuminati hotties in person when they come through NYC. Send me recommendations if you've got 'em!
