I've been getting into [music made with a variety of instruments unique to the Asian continent](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7fqvCTtfHqSVNw2b2T3WjR?si=6b5d81b685984bab). I got introduced via BlueSky to a few more Shamisen-focused bands and God Of Shamisen was one of them. This song really moves and I've very much enjoyed listening to it. I love hearing more different types of instruments so if you have suggestions, reach out on BlueSky and let me know!
