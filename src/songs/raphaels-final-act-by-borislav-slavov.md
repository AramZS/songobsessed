Borislav Slavov has been in my playlists since I first heard his work in the last Larian game (the first I played) Divinity: Original Sin 2. He seems to mostly work with Larian in producing video game sound tracks and they've always been stand out work. Slavov has a tendency to leverage a fantasy sound to produce some noticeable but well-integrated tracks for video games. 

You can hear that in his instrument choices here and even in the way the music references through instrumentation choices both the fantasy setting and gives a lot of information about the character themselves.

This isn't the first time [Slavov](/artist/borislav-slavov/) has shown up on this list, nor is it the first of [his vocal-focused tracks](/songs/sing-for-me-lohse-version-by-borislav-slavov/). However, this is a fun one. Like ["Sing for Me"](/songs/sing-for-me-lohse-version-by-borislav-slavov/), it is a character in the game vocalizing their own music in character, but here it's sort of a campy, almost operatic track. I guess I should note that if you're playing the game, or planning to, it has some spoilers in it. 

I know that this is a *particularly* nerdy pick for the site, but I've been listening to and enjoying it a lot. I don't know if it has the same impact without the context of having played the game but hopefully anyone can get some joy out of it. 

There's a [fun interview with the vocalist who is the voice actor behind the character](https://youtu.be/l1h5Zug84gw?si=N5VWfbqCnntGP5Jh) which I recommend. It's just one little slice of how much has gone into Baldur's Gate 3, which I've been playing a lot of. It's great!
